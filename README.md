Wine Prediction Model Notebook
-----------------------------
[This](Wine_Prediction_model.ipynb) Jupyter notebook contains the detailed analysis and modeling process for predicting customer wine purchasing behavior using various machine learning models. The Extra Tree Regressor model was found to have the highest R^2 value, indicating its ability to predict the amount of wine a customer would purchase.

Project Report
-----------------------------
[This](Customer_Purchase_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.pdf) analyzes customer purchasing behavior and demographics to determine the most accurate prediction model. The most important features found in the Extra Tree Regressor model were "Number of Store Purchases", "Income", "Number of Catalog Purchases", "Accepting a Coupon by the 5th Period", and "Amount of Meat Purchased". These features can be utilized by the marketing team to target customers with similar characteristics in order to drive wine sales.
